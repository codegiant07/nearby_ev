        <h3>About EV Charging Station</h3>
        <p>
          <b> A charging station</b>, also called an EV charger or electric
          vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is a piece of equipment that supplies
          electrical power for charging plug-in electric vehicles (including
          hybrids, neighborhood electric vehicles, trucks, buses, and others).
        </p>
        <p>
          Although batteries can only be charged with DC power, most electric
          vehicles have an onboard AC-to-DC converter that allows them to be
          plugged into a standard household AC electrical receptacle.
          Inexpensive low-power public charging stations will also provide AC
          power, known as "AC charging stations". To facilitate higher power
          charging, which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters, the
          converter is built into the charging station instead of the vehicle
          and the station supplies already-converted DC power directly to the
          vehicle, bypassing the vehicle's onboard converter. These are known as
          "DC charging stations". Most fully electric car models can accept both
          AC and DC power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charging stations provide connectors that conform to a variety of
          standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple
          connectors to be able to supply a wide variety of vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Public charging stations are typically found street-side or at retail
          shopping centers, government facilities, and other parking areas.

                    <h3>Types of charging stations:</h3>
                    <P> Mode 1. The type of charging has the lowest power. At the moment it is absolutely not relevant. Among other things, the stations of this connection are unsafe and require 12 hours for the implementation of direct, the charge of the
                        car.
                    </P>
                    <P>Mode 2. This is a more standard representative of the charging station. This type of charging station is in wide use. The charge takes 6 to 8 hours. The cable of the car is equipped with a special device - Control Box, which provides
                        increased security.</P>
                    <P>Mode 3. It is also an alternating current station, the advantage of which is in high power.</P>
                    <p>Mode 4. The station of direct current (previously mentioned station worked at AC power) allows rapid reloading. However, such high power is not designed for any type of electric car. The construction of such a station and its maintenance
                        requires large expenses. And therefore, such items are not available in every city and country.</p>
                    <p> Special attention is worthy of Tesla Supercharger stations, the principle of which is based on the infused of energy.</p>
